# backend:
# terraform state is local
# if in a team, diff people make change will have diff state of infrastructure
# Terraform state should be in sync, then Terraform state file should be same across all execution
# best to put Terraform state file in a remote location (AWS S3)

# with backend state in S3, other change by diff people will be updated to backend state
# to achive the state concept of marntaining infrastructure in same level in /
# a centralized location that can support mutiple changes applied.
